# Database-Managment-Final-Project

This is the semester project for my Database Management Course.  The objective of the project was to create a MySQL Database from scratch.  The approach to create the database was to begin with an Entity Relationship Diagram and then implement the various entities in MySQL.   Once finished, the database was tested for completeness using a variety of SQL queries.  The output of the queries was tested against the instructors solutions.  The MySQL DB and queries tested correctly and grade for this project was an A.
